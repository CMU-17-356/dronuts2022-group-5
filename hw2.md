##### A short justification for which user stories you are including in your MVP



#### A short document that describes which backend framework you are choosing, and why you decided on that framework

>### Loopback
>
>Pros:
>
>- Loopback example programs are well-structured will clear separation between routers, controllers, and models (https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/todo/src)
>- Loopback has its own ORM Module
>
>Cons:
>
>- Loopback's syntax is very different from vanilla Javascript, which significantly increases the difficulties of development in the early phase of the project
>- Loopback is less popular than express, which mean less learning materials and job opportunities. https://nodejs.libhunt.com/compare-loopback-vs-express 

>### Express 
>
>Pros:
>
>- most popular node.js backend framework
>- Familiar syntax
>
>Cons:
>
>- The controllers and routers in express is not separated https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app/blob/master/routes/api/profiles.js. But we can separate them manually.
>- Express framework do not have ORM.
