##### A short justification for which user stories you are including in your MVP



#### A short document that describes which backend framework you are choosing, and why you decided on that framework

>### Loopback
>
>Pros:
>
>- Loopback example programs are well-structured will clear separation between routers, controllers, and models (https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/todo/src)
>- Loopback has its own ORM Module
>
>Cons:
>
>- Loopback's syntax is very different from vanilla Javascript, which significantly increases the difficulties of development in the early phase of the project
>- Loopback is less popular than express, which mean less learning materials and job opportunities.  https://nodejs.libhunt.com/compare-loopback-vs-express 

>### Express 
>
>Pros:
>
>- most popular node.js backend framework
>- more open source libraries and community supports.
>- Familiar syntax
>
>Cons:
>
>- The controllers and routers in express is not separated https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app/blob/master/routes/api/profiles.js. But we can separate them manually.
>- Express framework do not have ORM. (can be sovled using separate ORM libraries like Sequelize)

Dear Investors,

Thank you for your interest in Dronut, our next-generation solution for donut delivery. Dronut will be powered by Express, a NodeJS backend framework widely used in the industry. Express is famous for its  light-weight, which enables us to move fast and deliver impacts in months. This feature also indicates that Express softwares take less engineers to maintain, and therefore allow us to focus our strength in development. 

Separately,  Express is most popular NodeJS  backend framework. Hence, we will be able to take advantage of its active community and fix defects in the program efficiently. In addition, the popularity of NodeJS also ensures most Javascript libraries can be plugined to the system without conflicts.

In conclusion, Express may not be the best backend framework. It certainly is the most suitable framework for our team. It allows us as a small startup to make big impact.
